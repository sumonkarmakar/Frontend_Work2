    <h2>Spaces inside the paragraph</h2>
    <p>  
        I am  
        going to provide  
        you a tutorial on HTML  
        and hope that it will  
        be very beneficial for you.  
        </p>  
        <p>  
        Look, I put here a lot  
        of spaces                    but            I know, Browser will ignore it.  
        </p>  
        <p>  
        You cannot determine the display of HTML</p>  
        <p>because resized windows may create different result.
